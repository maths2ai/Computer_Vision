# Introduction  

In this repository, which is highly inspired by the Udacity DL course, we use a VGG net to extract style features from an image and 
content features from another image.
We then try to make a new image so that its content and its style are as close as we want to the initial images.

## Requirements

torch, torchvision, numpy, matplolib, PIL.

### The models are a friend of mine and my dog!
