# Introduction

This folder contains a project in Pytorch, which is largely inspired by a course I have attended at Udacity.
The project contains a CNN model that predicts the content of images from the dataset CIFAR 10.
The images are downloaded and augmented (rotated, flipped etc.) to prevent overfitting.

# Requirements

You have to download torch, and if it is not included in your download, you have to download also torchvision.
