# Introduction

I have implemented, on CIFAR 10 Keras Implementation, the paper HighWay Net.
The paper that can be found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00387.pdf,
finds a way to create a very deep neural network that is not affected by the vanishing gradient problem.
An easy explanation of the technique can be also read on my website here https://www.m2ai.it/ai/deep-learning/highway-net/.
